Many non-deep learning based methods for point cloud upsampling have been proposed in the past such as moving least squares interpolation (MLS interpolation) in 2002 \cite{Alexa2003ComputingAR},
Locally Optimal Projection (LOP) in 2007 \cite{LOP}, Edge Aware Resampling (EAR) in 2013 \cite{EdgeAwareResampling} and graph total variation in 2019 \cite{GraphTotalVariation}.


MLS works by fitting a continuous surface to a set of local points using a weighted least squares fit of a polynomial surface to the points. 
Points are added by computing the voronoi cells on the local surface and adding points to the vertices of the diagram.

LOP unlike MLS does not require fitting a local surface. Instead, it uses a projection operator to project points onto a surface in a way that minimizes the sum of the weighted distances between the original and projected points. Improvements to LOP such as weighted LOP \cite{WLOP} were proposed that make LOP more robust to noise and outliers. 

Both MLS and LOP have demonstrated good results but a common problem with these methods is they don't perform well on sharp edges and corners, as the model often assumes a smooth surface.
