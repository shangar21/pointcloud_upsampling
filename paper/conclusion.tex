In conclusion, this paper presents BOLT, a novel fast and parameter free method for upsampling point clouds.
Our method leverages the structural efficiency of the octree data structure and detail preserving properties of the bilateral filter to achieve a fast and parameter free upsampling method.
Unlike the current state-of-the-art deep methods, BOLT does not require any parameters, deep learning, fine tuning, GPU or any type of training making it a suitable candidate for real-time applications.
We evaluate BOLT on various point clouds and compare it with the current state-of-the-art methods and show competitive results.
In future work, we plan to implement BOLT in C++ and add concurrency to reduce the overhead and improve the execution time.
