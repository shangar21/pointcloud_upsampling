Idea:
Given a sparse point cloud, we want to output a dense point cloud that is consistent with the input. 
We also want this to be done fast.

Implementation:
test hypothesis: Adding points to child of deep octree will upscale point cloud well, or atleast close enough for a parameter free / deterministic method to finish.
